# Simple-Reverse-Shell
This is a simple Reverse Shell I made in python. While the client program is executed it gives back a cmd shell to the C2 server which is the hackers machine. The cmd shell can execute any command a normal cmd shell can. 


Anyone is welcome to modify the contents of this simple script and feel free to share.
