# Project Title: Python Reverse Shell & Obfuscation Framework

# ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This repository is intended solely for cybersecurity education, malware analysis, and obfuscation research.
It must never be used for unauthorized access, surveillance, or exploitation.


# 🧩 Core Components

1. Obfuscation Module
2. Encodes and compresses scripts using zlib, marshal, and base64.
3. Illustrates typical obfuscation layers found in malware.
4. Command-and-Control (C2) Simulation
5. Persistence & Anti-Analysis Concepts
6. Data Collection and Monitoring (Simulated)
7. visualize system information

# 🧪 Safe Testing Setup

> Use a virtual machine (VM) such as VirtualBox or VMware.
> Use Python 3.10+ in a controlled environment.
> Do not distribute executable files.



# 🛠️ Requirements

1. Python ≥ 3.10
2. PyInstaller (for packaging examples)
3. pyautogui (for UI testing, optional)
4. zlib, base64, marshal (standard libraries)
